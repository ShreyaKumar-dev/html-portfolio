<h2>My top 4 movies of all times</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>
    The movie shows a complete new perspective of whole education system.
    Also teaches students, aspirants, i mean all learners how to study, grasp and gain profit from the stuff you study in correct way.<br />
    The famous dialouge of this movie is "Kaabil bano kaabil, success jhak marke piche aegi" 
</p>
<h3>Jab We Met</h3>
<p>
    This movies shows the most joyfull, open way to live life fully.
    Thou the movie characters goes under hard time at some point of time, but they were motivated enough to copeup with it and still live fully.

<h3>Miss India</h3>
<p>
    This movie is solemnly about an enterpreniur.
    It's the most inspiring movie for me not only as an enterpreniurship but way many more ways.

<h3>Bhool Bhulaiya</h3>
<p>
    This movie is perfect blend of humour, paranormality and pyschology.
